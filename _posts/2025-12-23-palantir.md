The divergence between retail sentiment and institutional action on Palantir (PLTR) has closed. We are witnessing the "Standardization Phase" of the company.

### 1. The Institutional Rotation
Fundamentally, money flows are shifting.
- **Fund Sentiment**: Our analysis of institutional ownership shows a **~60% ownership stake**, with a **140% increase in Fund Sentiment Score** over the last 6 months.
- **The Signal**: When giants like Vanguard and BlackRock increase positioning, they aren't trading for a 10% swing. They are positioning for a multi-year compounding arc.
- **Analyst Coverage**: While price targets vary ($175-$255 range), the consensus is shifting from "niche gov-tech" to "enterprise AI staple".

### 2. Commercial Velocity > Gov Stability
For years, the bear case was "growth is capped by government contracts." 2025 earnings guidance destroys this thesis.
- **US Commercial Revenue**: Growing at **100%+ YoY**.
- **Net Income**: Projected to exceed **$2 Billion** in 2025.
- **Free Cash Flow**: Approaching **$6 Billion**.
The flywheel has activated: *AIP (Artificial Intelligence Platform)* is not just a tool; it is the deployment layer for LLMs in the enterprise.

### 3. Management Discussion & Analysis (MD&A) Insights
Reading the latest 10-Q, one phrase stands out: **"Bootcamps."**
Sales cycles have compressed from 6 months to 6 days. Management is no longer selling "software"; they are selling "outcome acceleration." The shift from high-touch forward deployed engineers to scaling software margins is evident in their expanding operating leverage.

### Conclusion
Palantir is no longer a speculative bet. It is becoming the S&P 500's primary exposure to applied AI. We remain long.
