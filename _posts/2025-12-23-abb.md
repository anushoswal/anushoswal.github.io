summary: "From data centers to factory floors, ABB sells the picks and shovels for the two biggest trends of the decade: Electrification and Automation."

ABB is a 130-year-old startup. After divesting its lower-margin businesses, it remains as a pure-play on the modernization of the industrial world.

## The Twin Engines: Electrification & Robotics
- **Electrification**: The grid needs to triple in capacity. Data centers are demanding GW-scale power. ABB's order backlog ($8.69B) reflects this insatiable demand.
- **Robotics**: With the upcoming spin-off expected in 2026, the market will finally value this jewel separately. ABB holds a **75% market share** in collaborative robots.

## Analyst Sentiment & Valuations
Wall Street is split, which is exactly where we like to be.
- **The Bear Case**: Valuation concerns. "Hold" ratings dominate because the stock isn't "cheap" by traditional industrial metrics.
- **The Bull Case**: Citi and others see the Robotics spin-off as a catalyst for unlocking value that isn't on the balance sheet today.

## The 2025 Investing Thesis
75% of manufacturing leaders expect to increase EV production. The Internet of Robotic Things is growing at 14% CAGR.

ABB sits at the intersection of these vectors.

**Management's Goal**: An operational EBITA margin of **18-22%**. If they hit this while growing comparable revenue at 5-7%, ABB becomes a compounding machine with a defensive moat that software companies can only dream of.
