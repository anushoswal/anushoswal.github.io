Laurus Labs (LAURUSLABS) offers a masterclass in capital allocation pivot. Known for APIs, they are aggressively re-rating into a Contract Development and Manufacturing Organization (CDMO).

### 1. The CDMO Growth Engine
The numbers tell the story of a transformation.
- **Revenue Shift**: CDMO now contributes **30% of revenues** (up from 19% in FY21).
- **Growth Velocity**: The small-molecule CDMO segment grew **88% YoY** in H1 FY26.
They aren't just making pills anymore; they are partnering on the science.

### 2. CapEx Cycle & Capacity
Laurus is in the middle of a massive CapEx cycle (**₹1,000 Cr/year**).
- **Visakhapatnam**: Doubling fermentation capacity for biologics/proteins.
- **The Risk/Reward**: Markets hate CapEx cycles because they depress free cash flow today. We love them because they build the capacity for tomorrow's revenue.

### 3. Analyst Consensus vs. Reality
Analysts are largely "Neutral" or "Sell" due to short-term API weakness and high valuations.
- **Our View**: The market is looking at quarter-over-quarter API pricing. We are looking at the 5-year outlook for global pharma supply chains moving away from China ("China Plus One").
- **Earnings Power**: With net profit jumping **882% YoY** in Q2 FY26 off a low base, the operating leverage is kicking in. Long-term earnings are forecast to grow at **25%+** annually.
