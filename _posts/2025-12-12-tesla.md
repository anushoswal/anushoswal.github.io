We are entering a phase where software no longer just assists human action but replaces it entirely.

In the Tesla ecosystem, we see this transition happening in real-time. The removal of the steering wheel is not just a design choice; it is a declaration that the human is now cargo.

## The Capital Efficiency of Robots
When you remove the driver, the cost per mile drops below the cost of a bus ticket. This is the operational leverage I talk about often.

## The Size of the Prize
The math suggests we are looking at total addressable markets (TAM) measured not in billions, but trillions.

### Robotaxi: Mobility as a Service
ARK Invest estimates the global autonomous ride-hail market could generate **$10 trillion** in revenue over the next decade. At its core, this is a arbitrage on the cost of labor.
- **Current Cost**: Human-driven ride-hail ~$2-3/mile.
- **Robotaxi Cost**: Estimated <$0.30/mile.

This deflationary pressure will unlock demand elasticity that most analysts are modeling incorrectly.

### Optimus: The Labor Market Cap
The labor market is the largest market in the world (~$30 Trillion/year). Optimus represents the capitalization of physical labor.
- **Short Term**: Dangerous or repetitive tasks (manufacturing, logistics).
- **Long Term**: General purpose utility.

Even capturing 1% of the global labor market values the Optimus program higher than any currently existing company. Conservative estimates place the humanoid robot market at **$5-7 Trillion by 2050**, but the ceiling is effectively the bounds of the global economy.
