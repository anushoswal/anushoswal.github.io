summary: "Firstsource is executing a textbook pivot from BPO to Tech Platform. The market is slowly waking up to the margin expansion story."
---

The Business Process Outsourcing (BPO) industry is facing an existential crisis due to AI. Firstsource Solutions (FSL) has chosen to cannibalize itself before the market does.

## The "UnBPO" Strategy
Management has coined the term "UnBPO" to describe their shift to an AI-first architecture.
- **The Thesis**: Replace headcount with "relAI"—their proprietary suite of AI platforms.
- **Results**: Q2 FY26 revenue grew **20.1% YoY**, proving that tech-led services grow faster than labor-led ones.

## Earnings & Analyst Outlook
The street is bullish, but cautious.
- **Estimates**: Analysts forecast **19.1% annual EPS growth** over the next 3 years.
- **The Kicker**: Margins. As they shift from "FTEs" (Full Time Employees) to "outcomes," operating margins are projected to stabilize at **11.25-12%**. This doesn't look like a tech company yet, but the trajectory is rerating.

## Investment Rationale
We believe the market is pricing FSL as a legacy call center operator. In reality, they are becoming a domain-specific vertical AI company for Healthcare and Banking.
- **Strategic Acquisitions**: The purchase of AccunAI (GenAI dev) signals intent.
- **The Play**: We are buying the transition. If they successfully reach their **$1 Billion run-rate by Q4 FY26**, the multiple expansion will be significant.
